Put the sequence data to be analyzed into a separate directory, which only supports FNA suffix sequence file;

Enter the address of the directory, and the program will automatically analyze it.

Three files were obtained after the analysis

1. File with 'result!_' at the beginning of filename: indicates the CRISPRs containing score information found by findcrispr. 
Each line represents a CRISPR, includes the starting position of the repeater separated by ',' ,’#####‘，score，’:‘，repeater sequence，’@‘，the copy number of repeater sequence，’$‘，the length of repeater sequence，’__‘ ,the spacer sequences separated by ''

2.  File with '-show.txt ' at the end of filename: indicates that the CRISPRs found by findcrispr  displayed in a more readable format.
All CRISPRs are marked with crispr1, crispr2,... And crispr1, for example, is marked with the starting position, sequences and lengths of repeaters and spacers. 

3.png image file: indicates that the CRISPRs found by findcrispr  displayed in pictures.

A rectangle and a diamond represent a CRISPR. The number +'x' marked on the top of the rectangle represents the number of copies of the repeater. 
The number on the left of the rectangle represents the length of the repeater sequence. 
The number below the rectangle represents the starting position of the CRISPR. 
The number on the right of the diamond represents the ending position of the CRISPR
The rectangle and diamond of each CRISPR are represented by different colors and connected by a straight line according to their orders in the gene sequences.
